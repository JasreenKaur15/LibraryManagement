# 📘 Library Management System (Java)

A simple and interactive console-based Library Management System built using Java. This project was created to help manage a library's book records, including book details, issue tracking, and basic search functionalities. It's a great example of how Java's object-oriented principles and file handling can be used to build real-world applications.
